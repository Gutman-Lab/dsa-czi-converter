# JPEG2000 Compression Test Results

## Test Overview
- **Test Region**: 2Kx2K (2048x2048 pixels) from center of CZI file
- **Input File**: `1-254-MFG_AT8.czi` (2.3GB)
- **Test Date**: July 17, 2024
- **Purpose**: Verify JPEG2000 compression functionality and losslessness

## Key Findings

### 1. JPEG2000 Compression Works ✅
- JPEG2000 compression successfully processes the 2Kx2K region
- Both lossless and lossy modes produce identical results
- File size reduction: **61.4%** (from 15.94 MB to 6.16 MB)

### 2. JPEG2000 is NOT Truly Lossless ⚠️
- **Max pixel difference**: 3 (out of 255)
- **Mean pixel difference**: 0.98
- **Standard deviation**: 0.86
- Even with `lossless=True` parameter, JPEG2000 introduces small color variations

### 3. Deflate Compression is Truly Lossless ✅
- **Max pixel difference**: 0
- **Mean pixel difference**: 0.0000
- **File size reduction**: 40.4% (from 15.94 MB to 9.50 MB)

## Detailed Results

| Compression | Lossless | File Size | Compression Ratio | Processing Time | Max Diff | Mean Diff | Status |
|-------------|----------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|----------|-----------|---------|
| None | N/A | 15.94 MB | 0% | 1.33s | 0 | 0.0000 | Baseline |
| Deflate | Yes | 9.50 MB | 40.4% | 1.56s | 0 | 0.0000 | ✅ Perfect |
| JPEG2000 | Yes | 6.16 MB | 61.4% | 7.65s | 3 | 0.9757 | ⚠️ Near-lossless |
| JPEG2000 | No | 6.16 MB | 61.4% | 7.54s | 3 | 0.9757 | ⚠️ Near-lossless |

## Recommendations

### For Perfect Color Fidelity
- **Use Deflate compression** (`--compression deflate`)
- Provides 40.4% file size reduction
- Guaranteed pixel-perfect lossless compression
- Faster processing than JPEG2000

### For Maximum File Size Reduction
- **Use JPEG2000 compression** (`--compression jp2k`)
- Provides 61.4% file size reduction
- Acceptable for most applications (max 3/255 pixel difference)
- Slower processing than deflate

### For Critical Applications
- **Avoid JPEG2000** if pixel-perfect accuracy is required
- Use deflate compression instead
- Consider the trade-off between file size and color accuracy

## Technical Notes

### JPEG2000 Implementation
- Uses libvips with `compression='jp2k'` and `lossless=True`
- Despite lossless flag, still introduces small variations
- This appears to be a limitation of the libvips JPEG2000 implementation

### Test Methodology
- Extracted 2Kx2K region from center of large CZI file
- Used pyvips for image processing and comparison
- Verified losslessness by pixel-by-pixel comparison
- All tests used 256x256 output tiles with pyramid generation

### File Structure
- All output files include pyramid levels for multi-resolution viewing
- TIFF files are BigTIFF format for large image support
- Includes sub-IFD structure for efficient tiled access

## Conclusion

JPEG2000 compression **works** but is **not truly lossless** even with the lossless flag. For applications requiring perfect color fidelity, use deflate compression instead. For applications where small color variations are acceptable, JPEG2000 provides excellent compression ratios.

The maximum pixel difference of 3/255 (about 1.2%) is likely acceptable for most scientific imaging applications, but users should be aware of this limitation.
